# Tier 3: Working in Public

## What is a Tier 3 Project?

A **Tier 3** project is an **open collaboration** effort where the work is conducted in public. The project is led by smaller, semi-open teams but encourages **limited external contributions**. The work is typically **open source**, but the direction and maintenance of the project are CMS-led, controlled by a smaller group or team, rather than a large, decentralized community. Tier 3 projects may be public-facing tools, utilities, or websites, where external contributions are welcomed but managed closely by the core team.

> The Tier 3 repository template can be found in [`{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}`](./{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}/) and is offered as a GitHub template repository: https://github.com/DSACMS/tier3

### Key Characteristics of a Tier 3 Project:

- **Collaborative in public**, where the work is open to external stakeholders.
- Led by a **CMS team** (often organizational or tool-specific).
- Accepts **limited contributions from external sources**, typically following specific guidelines.
- Publicly accessible code and documentation.
- Maintenance and decision-making are generally led by CMS.

## .github directory

The .github directory includes various files such as GitHub action workflows, code.json metadata cookiecutter creation, and issue templates. For more information, please visit the [.github-directory.md]([../docs/.github-directory.md).

## Repository Hygiene using repolinter

As part of maintaining repository hygiene, repolinter is used to identify missing files and information. `repolinter.json` defines a set of checks that verify the existence of these files in your repository. To run repolinter, execute the following command from the root directory:

```
repolinter lint .
```

A GitHub action is also available for running repolinter checks. For more information, please visit [README.md](https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder?tab=readme-ov-file#identify-missing-files-and-information-using-repolinter).
