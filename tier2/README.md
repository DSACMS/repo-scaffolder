# Tier 2: Close Collaboration

## What is a Tier 2 Project?

A **Tier 2** project is a **collaborative effort** that typically occurs within a team or operational division (OpDiv). The project follows an **innersource working style**, where internal teams collaborate using open source best practices but within the confines of a private or internal environment. The project is not meant for broad public contribution but rather for **internal collaboration**.

Innersource projects often allow different teams within the same organization to contribute, fostering collaboration and code-sharing internally while maintaining control over external access.

### Key Characteristics of a Tier 2 Project:
- Focuses on **collaborating within a smaller team** or internal group.
- Utilizes **innersource practices**, where internal teams work collaboratively on code, borrowing from open source workflows but keeping the work within the organization.
- Projects may be shared among internal stakeholders or divisions.
- **Not necessarily accepting contributions** from the broader community.
