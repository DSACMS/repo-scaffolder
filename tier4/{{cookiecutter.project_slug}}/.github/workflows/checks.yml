          #   and set the exit code to result.passed. This output type is most useful for
          #   PR status checks.
          # * "issue": repolinter-action will create a GitHub issue on the current
          #   repository with the repolinter output and always exit 0. See the README for
          #   more details on issue outputting behavior. This output type is ideal for
