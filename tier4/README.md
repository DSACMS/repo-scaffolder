# Tier 4: Community Governance

## What is a Tier 4 Project?

A **Tier 4** project is a fully **open and collaborative** project that operates under a **community governance model**. In Tier 4 projects, the focus is on **collaborating broadly with the public**, and the project is often either **donated** to or **stewarded** by an external community. The governance structure is **open** and welcomes input from a wide range of contributors, typically from outside the original development team.

### Key Characteristics of a Tier 4 Project:
- **Broad public collaboration** with contributions welcomed from the community.
- **Community-led governance**, where decisions are made transparently, often with input from various stakeholders.
- **Mature open-source project**, typically with a well-defined governance structure to guide development, maintenance, and project direction.
