# Tier 1 Project: One-Time Release

## What is a Tier 1 Project?

A **Tier 1** project refers to an **informational or historical** project that has been **released publicly**. However, it does **not** have planned future updates or maintenance by the original authors or contributors. These projects typically include code samples, prototypes, public documentation, or other types of resources that are made available for use but won't receive ongoing updates or active development.

The main purpose of a Tier 1 project is to share knowledge and provide information from past work or experiments. Though available for public consumption, the project is **not expected to evolve or expand** in the future. Contributors may not engage in continuous development or issue resolution.

### Key Characteristics of a Tier 1 Project:
- **Publicly released** without planned future development or maintenance.
- Primarily **informational or historical** in nature.
- May still provide value to the community, but it is not actively worked on.
