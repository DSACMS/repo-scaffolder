## Core Team

An up-to-date list of core team members can be found in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md). At this time, the project is still building the core team and defining roles and responsibilities. We are eagerly seeking individuals who would like to join the community and help us define and fill these roles. -->

<!-- 
## Documentation Index 

TODO: This is a like a 'table of contents" for your documentation. Tier 0/1 projects with simple README.md files without many sections may or may not need this, but it is still extremely helpful to provide "bookmark" or "anchor" links to specific sections of your file to be referenced in tickets, docs, or other communication channels.

## Repository Structure

 TODO: Using the "tree -d" command can be a helpful way to generate this information, but, be sure to update it as the project evolves and changes over time.-->

## Local Development

 TODO - with example below:
This project is monorepo with several apps. Please see the [api](./api/README.md) and [frontend](./frontend/README.md) READMEs for information on spinning up those projects locally. Also see the project [documentation](./documentation) for more info.

<!--
## Coding Style and Linters

TODO - Add the repo's linting and code style guidelines

Each application has its own linting and testing guidelines. Lint and code tests are run on each commit, so linters and tests should be run locally before committing.

## Branching Model

TODO - with example below:
This project follows [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), which means:

* Make small changes in [short-lived feature branches](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/short-lived-feature-branches/) and merge to `main` frequently.
* Be open to submitting multiple small pull requests for a single ticket (i.e. reference the same ticket across multiple pull requests).
* Treat each change you merge to `main` as immediately deployable to production. Do not merge changes that depend on subsequent changes you plan to make, even if you plan to make those changes shortly.
* Ticket any unfinished or partially finished work.
* Tests should be written for changes introduced, and adhere to the text percentage threshold determined by the project.

This project uses **continuous deployment** using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) which is configured in the [./github/workflows](.github/workflows) directory.

Pull-requests are merged to `main` and the changes are immediately deployed to the development environment. Releases are created to push changes to production.
