# Contributing Guidelines 
<!-- Basic instructions about where to send patches, check out source code, and get development support.--> 
 
 We're so thankful you're considering contributing to an [open source project of the U.S. government](https://code.gov/)! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.
 
 We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md). 
 
 ## Getting Started 
<!--- TODO: If you have 'good-first-issue' or 'easy' labels for newcomers, mention them here.--> 
 
 ### Team Specific Guidelines 
<!-- TODO: This section helps contributors understand any team structure in the project (formal or informal.) Encouraged to point towards the MAINTAINERS.md file for further details.--> 
 
 ### Building Dependencies 
<!--- TODO: This step is often skipped, so don't forget to include the steps needed to install on your platform. If you project can be multi-platform, this is an excellent place for first time contributors to send patches!--> 
 
 ### Building the Project 
<!--- TODO: Be sure to include build scripts and instructions, not just the source code itself! -->
 
 ### Workflow and Branching 
<!--- TODO: Workflow Example
We follow the [GitHub Flow Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
1. Fork the project
2. Check out the `main` branch
3. Create a feature branch
4. Write code and tests for your change
5. From your branch, make a pull request against `{{ cookiecutter.project_org }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_repo_name }}/main`
6. Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed
7. Wait for your change to be pulled into `{{ cookiecutter.project_org }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_repo_name }}/main`
8. Delete your feature branch
-->
 
 ### Testing Conventions 
<!--- TODO: Discuss where tests can be found, how they are run, and what kind of tests/coverage strategy and goals the project has. --> 
 
 ### Coding Style and Linters 
<!--- TODO: HIGHLY ENCOURAGED. Specific tools will vary between different languages/frameworks (e.g. Black for python, eslint for JavaScript, etc...)
1. Mention any style guides you adhere to (e.g. pep8, etc...)
2. Mention any linters your project uses (e.g. flake8, jslint, etc...)
3. Mention any naming conventions your project uses (e.g. Semantic Versioning, CamelCasing, etc...)
4. Mention any other content guidelines the project adheres to (e.g. plainlanguage.gov, etc...)
--> 
 
 ### Writing Issues 
<!--- TODO: Example Issue Guides
 When creating an issue please try to adhere to the following format:
 module-name: One line summary of the issue (less than 72 characters)
 ### Expected behavior
 As concisely as possible, describe the expected behavior.
 ### Actual behavior
 As concisely as possible, describe the observed behavior.
 ### Steps to reproduce the behavior
 List all relevant steps to reproduce the observed behavior.
 see our .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md for more examples.
 -->
 
 ### Writing Pull Requests 
<!-- TODO: Make a brief statement about where to file pull/merge requests, and conventions for doing so. Link to PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file.
 Comments should be formatted to a width no greater than 80 columns.
 Files should be exempt of trailing spaces.
 We adhere to a specific format for commit messages. Please write your commit messages along these guidelines. Please keep the line width no greater than 80 columns (You can use `fmt -n -p -w 80` to accomplish this).
 module-name: One line description of your change (less than 72 characters)
 Problem
 Explain the context and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be thought of being the motivation for your change.
 Solution
 Describe the modifications you've done.
 Result
 What will change as a result of your pull request? Note that sometimes this section is unnecessary because it is self-explanatory based on the solution.
 Some important notes regarding the summary line:
 workflows Describe what was done; not the result
 workflows Use the active voice
 workflows Use the present tense
 workflows Capitalize properly
 workflows Do not end in a period — this is a title/subject
 workflows Prefix the subject with its scope
 see our .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md for more examples.
 -->
 
 ### Reviewing Pull Requests 
<!--- TODO: Make a brief statement about how pull-requests are reviewed, and who is doing the reviewing. Linking to MAINTAINERS.md can help.
 Code Review Example
 The repository on GitHub is kept in sync with an internal repository at github.cms.gov. For the most part this process should be transparent to the project users, but it does have some implications for how pull requests are merged into the codebase.
 When you submit a pull request on GitHub, it will be reviewed by the project community (both inside and outside of github.cms.gov), and once the changes are approved, your commits will be brought into github.cms.gov's internal system for additional testing. Once the changes are merged internally, they will be pushed back to GitHub with the next sync.
 This process means that the pull request will not be merged in the usual way. Instead a member of the project team will post a message in the pull request thread when your changes have made their way back to GitHub, and the pull request will be closed.
 The changes in the pull request will be collapsed into a single commit, but the authorship metadata will be preserved.
 -->
 
 ## Shipping Releases 
<!-- TODO: What cadence does your project ship new releases? (e.g. one-time, ad-hoc, periodically, upon merge of new patches) Who does so? --> 
 
 ## Documentation 
<!-- TODO: Documentation Example 
We also welcome improvements to the project documentation or to the existing docs. Please file an [issue](https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.project_org }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_repo_name }}/issues).
 -->
